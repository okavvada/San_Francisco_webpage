<c class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></c>Introduction</h3>
<p>Water reuse refers to the action of treating the wastewater to an acceptable standard in order to be able to be reused in other applications. Water reuse has been rapidly increasing in popularity especially in drought prone locations such as Califoria. Early adopters have already been thinking of enhancing their water portfolio by incorporating water reuse in their water mix. Water reuse has been identified as an efficient way of adding resiliency to the water infrastructure and providing solutions to alleviate some of the impacts of drought. Non-potable reuse (NPR) involves using recycled water for uses that do not require high quality water such as toilet flushing, irrigation, and other similar uses. This can help mitigate some of the treatment requirements but requires the construction and installation of a separate distribution system for the water to be reused. </p>

<p>The process of reusing the water involves specialized planning as the generated wastewater needs to be collected, treated and re-distributed to the points of demand. This process requires energy and emits greenhouse gases (GHG). Another important consideration is the effect of scale. Larger systems benefit from the "economies of scale", as the treatment process takes place in large facilities that are generally more efficient. The tradeoff here is that larger scale systems require more infrastructure and potentially more pumping for the water distribution as they are generally located further away from the point of demand. This tradeoff is of major importance when thinking of implementing water reuse systems and should be assessed in detail. The spatial parameters of an area along with water demands and pooulation density can be significant contributors in identifying the best way to implement water reuse. Spatial analysis along with a life-cycle assessment of the required infrastructure is of major importance to identify the right way to promote water resiliency with the minimal environmental impacts.</p>

<c class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></c>Problem Statement</h3>

<p>This work aims to assess different levels of decentralization for implementing non-potable water reuse. The goal of the study is to understand the effect of the spatial parameters and identify the threshold where the conveyance requirements outweigh the benefits of economies of scale identified in the treatment process. This work utilizes a life-cycle assessment methodology as a framework for assessing the energy use and GHG emissions of residential water reuse. To create a functionally equivalent comparison, the study compares decentralized systems implemented over a range of different scales with centralized water reuse, for different spatial conditions (e.g. topography and population density). The framework described here can be used as a planning support tool to include the energy and GHG impacts when integrating decentralized infrastructure for water reuse into an urban setting with existing centralized sewerage and wastewater infrastructure.</p>

<p>This work refers to previous research and is extending published results. The findings and results of the original study can be found in the Environmental Science and Technology Journal under the titled publication <a href="https://github.com/okavvada">Assessing Location and Scale of Urban Non-Potable Water Reuse Systems for Life-Cycle Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emissions.</a> The data used here has been adjusted to model the planned treatment process for centralized NPR in San Francisco which is more complex and energy intensive than conventional NPR treatment due to saltwater intrusion in the sewer system.</p>

<p>The funding for this research was provided by the National Science Foundation-funded <a href="http://renuwit.org"> Reinventing the Nationâ€™s Urban Water Infrastructure (ReNUWIt) Engineering Research Center</a> (NSF Grant No. CBET-0853512).
